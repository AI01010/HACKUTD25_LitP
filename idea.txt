im making an app to take pdf, excel, csv, word and extract data to 
send to an ML model combine with Zillow data set from kaggle and 
predict future price/property eval for next 5-10 yrs (or whatever is most viable for an ML model) 
and also givnig recommendations on what needs funding based on given reports 
and the property condtions extracted from that.

additional:
- take video/image and send it to an AI api like gemini to extract video/img data and do same thing.
- chatbot to get speciifcs queries/filters like: commerical property, housing, need for school/store/work/etc. to be near, etc.
- add hardware to the cam for the video/img recording


path1:
Nice — this is a great HackUTD project idea. I’ll lay out a practical, end-to-end plan you can implement quickly and iterate on: architecture, data & ML approach, document & image/video extraction options, feature engineering + model recommendations, explainability, UI/UX ideas (including chatbot), evaluation and demo/metrics, plus a realistic MVP roadmap and extras for a polished final. I’ll assume you’ll fuse uploaded docs (PDF/Word/Excel/CSV) + images/video + a Zillow Kaggle dataset as you said.

# Architecture (high level)

1. **Ingress / Upload**

   * Frontend: file upload (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV), image/video capture, or paste URL.
   * Backend API: accept files, store raw originals (S3), enqueue extraction job.

2. **Extraction pipeline (per file)**

   * **Text extraction**: PDFs/Word/Excel/CSV → text + metadata (pages, tables).
   * **Structured extraction**: detect tables, key/value fields, dates, monetary values, room counts, HVAC/roof ages, lease clauses, citations.
   * **Image & video extraction**: frame sampling for video, object detection, scene classification, defect detection, OCR on images.
   * Output: JSON record of extracted fields + attachments (images, tables).

3. **Enrichment**

   * Geocode property address.
   * Join Zillow Kaggle features (historic price, zip/census features) and public macro data if available (rent, unemployment, CPI) — create a combined time series per property/zip.

4. **Feature engineering & model input**

   * Combine extracted structural data (age, sqft, condition flags), lease/operational metrics from docs, and external features into a feature vector per property/time.

5. **Prediction & Recommendations**

   * Price/value forecasting model (5–10 year horizons — see caution below).
   * Risk/maintenance recommendation model that flags likely funding needs (roof, HVAC, structural, code compliance) and prioritizes by expected ROI / urgency.

6. **Explainability & UI**

   * Explanations per prediction (feature importance, SHAP summary, extracted evidence highlights).
   * Chatbot/search interface to ask questions and surface documents or predictions.

7. **Serving & Monitoring**

   * Model serving (FastAPI / torchserve), containerized, with logging, retraining pipeline, and model drift alerts.

# Document & Image/Video extraction techniques

* **PDF/Word/Excel/CSV**

  * Text: PDFMiner / PyMuPDF (fitz) or Tika for robust extraction.
  * Layout-aware models: LayoutLMv3 / Donut (for image-like PDFs) to extract form fields and table structure.
  * Table extraction: Camelot / Tabula-py for PDFs; pandas for CSV/XLSX.
  * Clause/NER extraction: spaCy custom NER or fine-tune a transformer for domain entities (lease expiration, capex items, warranty periods). Use rule-based fallback for numeric fields (regex for dates, dollar amounts).

* **Images & Video**

  * Frame extraction: sample every N seconds or use shot detection.
  * Object detection/classification: YOLOv8 or Faster R-CNN (detect assets: HVAC unit, roof damage, mold, cracks).
  * OCR: Tesseract or Google Vision / Gemini multimodal (if using API) for text on images.
  * Visual condition scoring: small CNN classifier (or use off-the-shelf vision LLM features) to map images to condition labels (good/fair/poor).
  * Video: feed extracted frames to the same image pipeline; also use audio transcription if present.

* **If using LLM / multimodal APIs (Gemini, GPT-4o multimodal)**

  * Send extracted text snippets + structured JSON for summarization, rationale generation, and Q/A. Keep LLM calls for summarization and chat — do heavy structured extraction offline.

# Data modelling & predictions

**Two complementary approaches** (blend for best results):

1. **Hedonic / cross-sectional + time features** (Gradient boosted trees)

   * Models: XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost for property valuation.
   * Inputs: structural attrs (sqft, beds, baths), condition flags, extracted operational costs, neighborhood metrics, historical sale prices (Zillow Kaggle), macro/time features.
   * Output: predicted price at horizon t (or % change). Use quantile models for uncertainty.

2. **Time-series forecasting per-aggregate or per-property**

   * If you have good historic price series per property: ARIMA/Prophet or LSTM/Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT).
   * If property-level series are sparse, forecast at ZIP/census tract and blend with hedonic adjustment per property.

**Horizon (5–10 years) advice**

* Long horizons increase uncertainty; recommend:

  * Provide both short-term (1–2 year) and long-term (5–10 year) forecasts.
  * Always return prediction intervals (e.g., 90% CI).
  * Explain assumptions (no major macro shock, baseline inflation).

# Features to engineer (priority)

* Property: year_built, sqft, units, type (commercial/residential), lot_size, stories.
* Condition: roof_age, HVAC_age, plumbing_evidence, mold_flag, structural_notes (from docs/images).
* Operational: energy_costs, maintenance_costs, occupancy_rate, lease_expiry_dates (next 12 months count).
* Market: historical_price_pct_change_1y/3y/5y, zip_median_income, vacancy_rate, school_score, walkscore (if available).
* Temporal: months_since_last_sale, macro_inflation, interest_rate_proxy.

# Recommendation logic (funding prioritization)

* Create score = f(urgency, expected_failure_cost, impact_on_value, time_to-failure). Example pipeline:

  1. From docs/images produce binary flags per asset (HVAC_issue, roof_leak).
  2. Estimate replacement/repair cost (use rules or lookup tables).
  3. Estimate lift in property value or avoided loss if fixed.
  4. Rank by ROI and urgency (e.g., critical safety issues top).

# Explainability & traceability

* **Evidence link**: every extracted fact (e.g., “roof leak mentioned on p.4”) attaches to source (file id, page, bounding box, image frame).
* **Model explainers**: SHAP for tree models; show top features affecting a single prediction.
* **Audit trail**: versioned extracts, model version, datasets used — display in UI.

# Chatbot / Smart Search UX

* Natural query examples:

  * “Show me Dallas commercial properties with energy cost > $X and leases expiring next quarter.”
  * “Which properties are highest priority for roof funding in 2026?”
* Internals: use embeddings (OpenAI/GPT/FAISS) over extracted text + metadata to find relevant docs, then LLM to synthesize answers and cite sources. Always return snippets and direct links to original docs.

# Evaluation, metrics & validation

* **Forecasting**: MAE, RMSE, and MAPE plus coverage of prediction intervals. Backtest with rolling windows.
* **Classification (need funding / hazard detection)**: precision/recall, F1, confusion matrix; cost-based evaluation (e.g., cost of missed critical issue).
* **Extraction QA**: document-level accuracy for extracted fields; manual sampling and precision/recall for named entities.
* **End-to-end demo metric**: “time to actionable insight” — how quickly a user finds the correct clause or recommended CAPEX.

# Tech stack (recommended)

* **Frontend**: React + Tailwind (or Next.js) + file upload, preview.
* **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), Celery/RQ for extraction jobs, Redis for queue.
* **Storage**: S3 for files, PostgreSQL for metadata, vector DB (Milvus / Pinecone / Weaviate) for embeddings.
* **ML**: PyTorch / Transformers + XGBoost / LightGBM.
* **Vision**: YOLOv8 or Detectron2 for object detection; OpenCV for preprocessing.
* **Embedding/search**: sentence-transformers + FAISS or managed vector DB.
* **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes or simpler (Fly / Render). CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

# MVP (what to build for HackUTD demo)

1. Upload PDF + single property Zillow history → extract key fields and display property summary.
2. Run a simple LightGBM model trained on Zillow Kaggle (use subset) to predict 2-year price change and show SHAP explanation.
3. Image upload (single photo of roof/HVAC) → run a damage classifier and flag maintenance.
4. Chatbot UI that answers a few queries using extracted text + prediction and links to source pages.
5. Dashboard showing top 5 funding recommendations with estimated ROI and evidence links.

# Data & simulation approach (if real data limited)

* Use Zillow Kaggle for pricing features.
* Simulate internal reports: create synthetic PDFs with structured fields (year installed, issue notes, CAPEX amounts). Use templates to generate many examples.
* For images: use open datasets for building damage or create a small labeled set (you can augment with synthetic transforms).

# Security, compliance & privacy

* PII handling: redact personal identifiers or encrypt them.
* Access control: role-based UI (analyst, manager).
* Logging and audit for all extraction and model actions.

# Demo storyboard (2–3 minute pitch)

1. Upload a property folder (PDF reports + images).
2. System extracts 10 key fields, joins Zillow, shows 2-year and 5-year predicted price ranges with SHAP explanation.
3. Dashboard shows recommended $120k roof repair — clicking shows extracted evidence (page 4: “roof leaks”) and supporting images.
4. Ask chatbot: “Which properties in Dallas need immediate funding?” — bot returns ranked list and allows exporting a funding request.

# Quick pitfalls & how to address them

* **Noisy extraction**: build human-in-the-loop corrections (annotate once, use to retrain).
* **Sparse historical series**: aggregate to zip/tract level for time-series then blend hedonic per property.
* **Overconfident long-term forecasts**: always show uncertainty intervals and scenario-based forecasts.

# Starter code snippets / next steps (what I’d build first)

1. a FastAPI endpoint to accept a PDF and return extracted key-values (use pdfplumber + regex + spaCy NER).
2. a simple LightGBM training notebook using Zillow Kaggle features to predict next-year % price change.
3. a React UI with file upload and preview, and a results card showing top 5 extracted fields + predicted price delta.
