im making an app to take pdf, excel, csv, word and extract data to 
send to an ML model combine with Zillow data set from kaggle and 
predict future price/property eval for next 5-10 yrs (or whatever is most viable for an ML model) 
and also givnig recommendations on what needs funding based on given reports 
and the property condtions extracted from that.

additional:
- take video/image and send it to an AI api like gemini to extract video/img data and do same thing.
- chatbot to get speciifcs queries/filters like: commerical property, housing, need for school/store/work/etc. to be near, etc.
- add hardware to the cam for the video/img recording
